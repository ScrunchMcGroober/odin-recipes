    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The world is a <em>mysterious</em> place. Things grow, and die,
        only to grow again. Life is no more a blessing than it is a curse; suffering
        is inevitable and expected, yet those equipped with the capacity to 
        understand this wild dance choose instead to bury their heads in the sand. Steeling
        oneself against the cold truth of the clouds, and the stars, and looking defiantly
        into the heart of the feeble - <em>that</em> is living.</p>
